# Attention Sampling - Pytorch
This repository was forked from [jorism1993's](https://github.com/jorism1993) repository [attention-sampling-pytorch](https://github.com/sara-nl/attention-sampling-pytorch) wish are a PyTorch rewrite of the [original repository](https://github.com/idiap/attention-sampling) there are the implementation (written in TensorFlow) of the the paper: ["Processing Megapixel Images with Deep Attention-Sampling Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03711).

See [attention-sampling-pytorch](https://github.com/sara-nl/attention-sampling-pytorch) for information about how it was done
